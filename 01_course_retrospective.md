## 1. What Went Well
- I felt most confident using **Git commands**, especially `git revert`, `rebase`, and `reset`, as well as practicing **macro and micro commits**.
- I became comfortable with Git because I used it repeatedly in activities and assignments, which helped build **muscle memory**.
- Although I am not fully confident in coding yet, I understand the concepts better and know that consistent practice will help me improve and apply them more effectively.

## 2. What Went Wrong / Challenges
- The most difficult topic for me was **React**, mainly because I had little background knowledge about it.
- Even with advance study, I found it hard to follow the lessons during class discussions.
- There were times when I understood the lesson in class, but became confused again when working on activities and assignments at home.
- During projects, my biggest challenges were **time management and pressure**, especially in my role as the **UI/UX designer**.
- Developers depended on the UI before they could start coding, which added pressure to complete designs quickly.
- Balancing multiple projects and activities from different subjects caused stress and sometimes led me to panic and lose focus.

## 3. Key Learnings
- I learned important **technical skills**, such as debugging and identifying which part of the code causes errors and why they happen.
- I gained a better understanding of **frameworks**, especially React, and realized how mastering the basics makes web development easier.
- I appreciated how the lessons were taught step by step, which helped me and my classmates follow and understand React better.
- In terms of **soft skills**, I learned the importance of **communication**, especially when working in a team.
- I realized that poor communication can cause a group to go off track, while proper coordination helps projects run smoothly.
- I also learned valuable life lessons, such as **Murphy’s Law**, which taught me to be more prepared, patient, and resilient when facing challenges.

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- I want to focus more on improving my **technical skills**, especially coding, by practicing more and challenging my self-doubt.
- I aim to improve my **UI/UX design skills** by studying Figma more deeply and creating more user-friendly designs.
- I want to avoid being a reason for delays by finishing my tasks **before the sprint ends**.
- I plan to dedicate more time to my responsibilities and improve my **time management and communication** during team projects.
- By updating my teammates regularly, I hope to help the team stay organized and on schedule.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I hope to gain a solid understanding of **JavaScript and TypeScript**, as I currently lack knowledge in these languages.
- I want to build a strong foundation in mobile development to improve my skills.
- I believe clear explanations, step-by-step lessons, and guided examples will help me understand the subject better.
- Regular practice, hands-on activities, and timely feedback will help me keep up with the course.
- By the end of the semester, I aim to become more confident and comfortable in developing mobile applications.
